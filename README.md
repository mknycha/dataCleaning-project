# dataCleaning-project
The repository contains my submission to the project from data cleaning course.
The purpose of this project is to prepare a data set for further analysis.
My submission contains four files:
- run_analysis.R - script in R containing the code I ran to clean the data, along with my comments,
- CodeBook.md - a code book describing where does the data comes from, what steps were taken in order to clean it, and what is the result.
- tidyData.txt - a table containg tidy data as a result of running the script.
- this README.md file.
